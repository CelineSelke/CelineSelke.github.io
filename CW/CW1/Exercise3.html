<div class="verse">
Boy, you'll be the death of me
You're my James Dean
You make me feel like I'm seventeen
You drive too fast
You smoke too much
But that don't mean a thing, 'cause I'm addicted to the rush
</div>

<div class="chorus">
'Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than live my life without you
'Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than live my life without you
</div>

<div class="verse">
You know I've been in love before
You're the first one I've ever seen that burns like gasoline
So light a match, turn off the lights
I'm holding on to you cause this might be our last night
<div class="verse">


<div class="chorus">
'Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than live my life without you
'Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than live my life without you
</div>
<div class="verse">
What I'm telling you
I'm giving you my life, it's in your hands
And what I'm gonna do
Is be a woman and you can be a man
And I wanna say
Nobody understands what we've been through
I'd rather give up everything
Than to live my, live my life without you
</div>
<div class="chorus">
'Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than live my life without you
'Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than live my life without you
